Dash is an open source framework for building data visualization interfaces. 
Released in 2017 as a Python library, itâ€™s grown to include implementations for R and Julia.
Dash helps data scientists build analytical web applications without requiring advanced web development 
knowledge.

Three technologies constitute the core of Dash:

Flask supplies the web server functionality.
React.js renders the user interface of the web page.
Plotly.js generates the charts used in your application.
